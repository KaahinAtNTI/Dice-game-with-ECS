**Introduction**
This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to developing the Guess the Dice Number Game using C# and Visual Studio. It aims to serve as a resource for understanding and contributing to the project.

**Technical Specifications and Design**
2.1. Game Mechanics Overview

The game presents the player with a virtual dice roll, and the objective is to guess the number rolled. Players input their guesses, and the game provides feedback on whether it is correct.

**2.2. Architecture Overview**

The game follows a simple architecture, utilizing C# for logic implementation and Visual Studio for development.

**2.2.1. Architectural Diagrams**

(Insert architectural diagrams here to illustrate the flow of the game.)

**2.2.2. Entities and Components**

The game does not employ a full-fledged Entity Component System (ECS) architecture but utilizes basic concepts of entities and components.

**Entities:**

Dice: Represents the virtual dice being rolled.

**Components:**

NumberComponent: Stores the number rolled on the dice.

GuessComponent: Stores the player's guess.

**Development Guidelines and Standards**

Follow C# coding conventions and best practices for maintainability and readability.

Maintain modularity in development for easier updates and additions.

Ensure clarity and readability in code to facilitate collaboration.

**Testing Framework and Coverage**

Implement unit tests to validate individual components and functionalities.

Consider integration testing to assess the overall behavior of the game.

Strive for high test coverage to ensure robustness and reliability.

**Versioning Information**

Game Version: 1.0.0
Visual Studio Version: 20xx.x
C# Version: 7.3 or higher

**Performance Metrics and Optimization**

Monitor performance metrics such as CPU usage and memory consumption.

Optimize code for efficiency and minimal resource usage.
Accessibility in Game Design

Implement a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.
Provide options for customizing game settings to accommodate different player preferences.


**Troubleshooting and FAQs**

Q: What if the game crashes upon launch?
A: Check for errors in the code and ensure all dependencies are properly configured.

Q: How can I handle incorrect guesses from the player?

A: Implement error-handling mechanisms to provide informative feedback to the player.

Best Practice Recommendations
Continuously test the game during development to identify and address issues early.

Document code effectively to aid understanding and maintenance.

Encourage community involvement and feedback for continuous improvement.
